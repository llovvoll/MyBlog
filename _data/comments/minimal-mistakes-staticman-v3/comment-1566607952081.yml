message: "Your guide deserves a static comment!\r\n\r\nAs the author of Minimal Mistake's docs for Staticman v3, I would like to clarify the setup a bit.\r\n\r\nFirst, the editing of the config files and the invitation to the Staticman bot can be done _in parallel_.  There's _no_ chronological order in these actions.  While writing the docs, I prefer personally putting the invitation mechanism first as it gives users a sense that the API instance is responding to users' HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nSecond, since eduardoboucas/staticman#219, Staticman supports GitLab.  As a result, Staticman is no longer bundled with the proprietary GitHub services.  I saw that as a way to a truly free (as in freedom) commenting system.  The \"Lab\" in \"Staticman Lab\" can refer to GitLab, as the head in the avatar\r\n\r\n![Staticman Lab](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43248772?s=400&v=4)\r\n\r\nillustrates.  In fact, the original goal of @staticmanlab is to test the aforementioned PR, in response to Staticman's author's request in the comments.  I would like to add a point that on GitLab, there's *no* need to hit the '/v3/connect/...' link because GitLab _doesn't_ have invitation acceptance mechanismâ€”once a user is invited to a GitLab repo, (s)he will be instantly granted the previleges in the GitLab repo.\r\n\r\nThird, the URL\r\n\r\n> `https://staticman3.herokuapp.com/v3/connect/github//`\r\n\r\nin your article has missed some parameters.  Interested reader may try to find the correct invitation link by browsing [Minimal Mistake's docs for Staticman v3](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#staticman-v3).\r\n\r\n> You may also choose a different Staticman instance other than staticmanlab.\r\n\r\nHere's some examples, like\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/staticmanaima\r\n2. https://github.com/BloggerBust-bot\r\n\r\nInstead of putting URL\r\n\r\n> `http://staticman3.herokuapp.com/v3/encrypt/`\r\n\r\nit would be clearer to say \"to hit the URL `http://staticman3.herokuapp.com/v3/encrypt/{secret-text}`\".\r\n\r\nLastly,\r\n\r\n> ```yml\r\n> # staticman.yml\r\n>   reCaptcha:\r\n>     enabled: true\r\n>     siteKey: \"\"\r\n>     secret: \"\"\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nthe above code block for Staticman repo config file is a sure way to get the mysterious and notorious \"500 Internal Server Error\".  When reCATPCHA v2 is switched on, `siteKey` and `secret` should contain the appropriate generated strings."
